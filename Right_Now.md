## Keybindings

[VIM]
- remapped start of line, end of line => 1,2
- JK to half a page up/down [Still need getting used to ]
- BUT USE MARKERS
  ma     <- bookmarker on a
  `a     <- go to that bookmark
  :marks <- shows all the marks set
  :delmarks a s d f <- deletes all those book marks

[TMUX]
- [Temporarily hide all the panes in a window]
  this is a really nice keybinding in tmux 
  Press prefix+z => hat particular pane would be your only view until you press the keybinding again
- meta + h/l => tmux tab navigation
- prefix + z => hide panes
- prefix+ ctrl+hjkl => resize panes

- the only command you really need in vimium => `?`
- Ctrl + space is HOW TO ENVOKE INTELLISENSE suggestion while in the middle of the word
    - now you can traverse the intellisense using ctrl + j/k
- shift + alt + [ / ] = Folding / Unfolding


## Temporary To-do
- Tmux session need to persist
- Remap vim emulator keybindings (JK to move half a page up / down )
- navigate using ctrl j/k in command pallate / file picker 
- bookmark extension explore ; reserve use of leader for marked lines management and naviagtion
