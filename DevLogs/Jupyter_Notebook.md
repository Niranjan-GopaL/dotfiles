## Initial Worries
- How to open it in browser ( once I am comfortable there, I'll do it in VSC )
    - Made a config file ```$ jupyter notebook --generate-config ```
    - made 2 modifications :- defaultBrowser="path to chrome" ; NotebookApp.use_rediret_file = True
    - made a powershell alias : Mapped `jn` -> jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=D:/"Code Practise"
