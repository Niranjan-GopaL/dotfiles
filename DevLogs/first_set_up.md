## 7. Installing Docker, setting up a NextJS project

```sh
sudo pacman -S gnome-terminal
sudo pacman -S docker

# when you do enable, it'll automatically do start too ; it's kinda redundant but oh well !
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo systemctl start  --now docker
# this will be the output 
# Created symlink '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service' â†’ '/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service'



sudo docker info                    # is docker running properly

sudo usermod -a -G docker niranjan  # to make docker be ran by a user otehr than root

sudo docker info                    # is docker running properly

su niranjan # log back into your account 


docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started  # now you have a guide that can be ran from localhost:80


# from AUR install docker desktop


```

#### Trouble shoot :-

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## 4. All the foldings made in this file is PERSISTENT 

Adding this to config :-

>  "editor.foldingStrategy":"auto",



## 3. Moving .zshrc to be inside .config

Quick commands ; Detailed gpt response below

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/zsh
$ mv ~/.zshrc ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc

$ ln -s ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc

# verification
$ ls -l ~/.zshrc
# You need to see something like :-
# ~/.zshrc -> ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc

```

Given that you are using the setup from the Prasanth Rangan repository, and all your configuration files are already organized within `~/.config`, it's important to maintain compatibility and avoid breaking any scripts or setups that rely on the standard location of `.zshrc`.

However, since you prefer to keep all configuration files in `~/.config`, let's carefully proceed by:

1. **Identifying Dependencies**:
   - Check any scripts or applications that might directly reference `~/.zshrc`.
   - Ensure that moving `.zshrc` won't disrupt any dependencies.

2. **Creating a Symlink**:
   - Instead of moving `.zshrc`, create a symlink from `~/.zshrc` to the new location within `~/.config`.

Here's how you can proceed:

### Steps to Move and Symlink `.zshrc`

1. **Move Your `.zshrc` to `~/.config/zsh/.zshrc`**:

   Create the necessary directory and move your `.zshrc` file:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/zsh
   mv ~/.zshrc ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Create a Symlink in the Home Directory**:

   Create a symbolic link from `~/.zshrc` to the new location:

   ```sh
   ln -s ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Verifying the Symlink

Ensure the symlink works by listing the details:

```sh
ls -l ~/.zshrc
```

You should see something like:

```sh
~/.zshrc -> ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc
```

### Testing the Configuration

1. **Reload Zsh**:

   Reload your Zsh configuration to ensure it's working properly:

   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Verify Functionality**:

   Add a test line to your new `.zshrc` in `~/.config/zsh/.zshrc` to confirm it's being sourced correctly:

   ```sh
   echo "Sourcing ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc"
   ```

Open a new terminal session, and you should see the message indicating the `.zshrc` file from `~/.config/zsh` is being sourced.

### Summary

By moving your `.zshrc` to `~/.config` and creating a symlink in the home directory, you maintain compatibility with any applications or scripts that expect to find `.zshrc` in the home directory while keeping your configuration files organized in `~/.config`. This approach provides the best of both worlds: cleanliness and compatibility.


## 2. Bluetooth
All you need is :-
```sh
$ blueman-manager
``` 

## 1. Connecting to Github in terminal via ssh [ GPT-4o ]

To set up SSH for GitHub and use it for pushing and pulling from your terminal, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key

1. **Open your terminal.**
2. **Generate a new SSH key:**

   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   - This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.
   - When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default file location.

3. **You will be prompted to enter a passphrase.** You can enter a passphrase for added security, or leave it empty.

### Step 2: Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent

1. **Start the SSH agent in the background:**

   ```sh
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

2. **Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent:**

   ```sh
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

### Step 3: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

1. **Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:**

   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   - Copy the output from the terminal, which is your SSH public key.

2. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:**

   - Go to [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys).
   - Click "New SSH key."
   - In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key (e.g., "My Laptop").
   - Paste your key into the "Key" field.
   - Click "Add SSH key."

### Step 4: Test the SSH Connection

1. **Test your connection:**

   ```sh
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

   - You should see a message like: "Hi `username`! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."

### Step 5: Configure Git to Use SSH

1. **Set your Git username and email:**

   ```sh
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Add your remote repository URL using SSH:**

   ```sh
   git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```

   - Replace `username` with your GitHub username.
   - Replace `repository` with the name of your repository.

### Step 6: Push and Pull Using SSH

1. **Clone a repository using SSH:**

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```

2. **Push changes to the repository:**

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin main
   ```

   - Replace `main` with the name of the branch you want to push to.

3. **Pull changes from the repository:**

   ```sh
   git pull origin main
   ```

   - Replace `main` with the name of the branch you want to pull from.

By following these steps, you will have configured your terminal to use SSH for GitHub, allowing you to securely push and pull code from your repositories.
