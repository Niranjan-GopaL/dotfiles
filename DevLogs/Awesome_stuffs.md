# Blown away by

My config feeels sooo smooth now := barely any finger movement since 
- Alt + j/k h/l => Allowing naviagation between any workspace and any tab in tmux
- I have only one terminal window with few kitty tabs and tmux tabs and navigation is entirely based on alt + vim bindings
- even browing is really smooth cuz of vimium


- NvChad's themeset ;
- tmux copy mode
- `yt-dlp`
- `mcp+ncmpcpp` => Music Library Customizaiton is NEVER_SEEN_BEFORE_LEVEL [EVEN_LYRICS_!!]
- `kitty`
- `tmux`
- you can add more wallpapers wayyy more customized
- each theme is UNIQUE (entirely)
- connected to both Laptop and Linux through same headphones
- sddm is HOT
- obs
- blender
- zathura


> ( please make the TP Link + Bluez work :cry :cry )
=> Worked !
